# Markov-Chain-Text-Generation-Program
Text Generation with Markov Chains in C++: Implemented an efficient text generation program using Markov chains with an adjacency list representation. Python script for corpus generation included.
Features:

Efficient adjacency list representation for enhanced program performance.
Python script (generateCorpus.py) provided for corpus generation from training data.
Usage:

Compile the C++ program using a suitable compiler.
Note: You may have to open the Python Script to enter desired .txt file
Execute the compiled program, specifying the desired parameters.
Explore the generated text output.
Feel free to customize and experiment with different training datasets to observe diverse text outputs.
Included: Pirate.txt("Howard Pyleâ€™s book of pirates, pulled from project guttenberg.") and a CorpusTest.txt file as an example to test code

Dependencies:

C++ compiler
Python (for corpus generation)
